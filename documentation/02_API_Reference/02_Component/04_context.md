## context

### `static` context = { name : Annotation }

Replacement for standard `contextTypes`. Just `Constructor` may be used as type annotation.

### `static` childContext = { name : Annotation }

Replacement for standard `childContextTypes`. Just `Constructor` may be used as type annotation.

`getChildContext()` function is required to create the context as in raw React.
