Record is the serializable class with typed attributes, observable changes, and custom validation checks.
It is the main building block for managing the application state; component local state, stores, and collection elements are all subclasses of the `Record`.

In contrast to the "model" class in the majority of data frameworks, Record is *not the key-value hash*. It's the class with statically
defined set of attributes of known types.
 
`Record` itself is an abstract class. The subclass needs to be defined for every data structure of different shape,
in a similar way as it's done in statically typed languages.

```javascript
import { define, Record } from 'type-r'

// ⤹ required to make magic work  
@define class User extends Record {
    // ⤹ attribute's declaration
    static attributes = {
        firstName : '', // ⟵ String type is inferred from the default value
        lastName  : String, // ⟵ Or you can just mention its constructor
        email     : String.value( null ), //⟵ Or you can provide both
        createdAt : Date, // ⟵ And it works for any constructor.
        // And you can attach ⤹ metadata to fine-tune attribute's behavior
        lastLogin : Date.value( null ).has.toJSON( false ) // ⟵ not serializable
    }
}

const user = new User();
console.log( user.createdAt ); // ⟵ this is an instance of Date created for you.

const users = new User.Collection(); // ⟵ Collections are defined automatically. 
users.on( 'changes', () => updateUI( users ) ); // ⟵ listen to the changes.

users.set( json, { parse : true } ); // ⟵ parse raw JSON from the server.
users.updateEach( user => user.firstName = '' ); // ⟵ bulk update triggering 'changes' once
```
