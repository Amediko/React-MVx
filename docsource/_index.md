	<strong>React-MVx</strong> bridges the gap between <a src="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>
     and traditional MVx architecture,
	combining the powerful OO state management and two-way data binding with all the benefits of the unidirectional data flow.

### Type-R for "M" and "VM"
 
* Single technique to manage UI and domain state.
* State is observable _and_ serializable by default.
* Declarative validation and run-time schema checks.
* 10 times faster than BackboneJS.

### React for "V"

* Handle forms naturally:
    * Two-way data binding
    * Transparent validation
* Cuts your code size 2-5x compared to React/Redux.

### Choose your "C"

* No router
